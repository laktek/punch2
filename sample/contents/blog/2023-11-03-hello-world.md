Whoever put me in charge of the company blog today is gonna live to regret it. I've tried so many versions of this story and tried to dodge the F-word, and they were sooooo… ugh.

So fuck it. You're gonna hear true unfiltered Stevey, ain't even going through Comms this time, because I'm honestly gettin' too old to be bothered with filters.

Let's go.

***Note: if you want to skip past the imposter syndrome self-flagellation and get to "What can Cody do for ME?!," [jump here](#cody-knows-your-code). TL;DR: Cody is launched and you can [download it now](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody).***

Do you want to know what my _lowest_ points have been, during my career as a professional programmer? I'll tell you. It's when someone hands me a nasty ancient old undocumented uncommented unholy fuck-all gigantic gob of code, and says, " **Stevey, you're senior. Own this code, and make the following changes in the following time frame."**

And I spend a week, just sorta trying to get a bird's-eye view of what the hell is going on, and then another week, and another week, and it's starting to look like I am NEVER going to understand this fuckin' code. And it becomes one of those moments when you realize you fucked up, and god knows how you got here, but the only honorable way out is career suicide. And you leave the job, the team, even the company, in misery and disgrace.
